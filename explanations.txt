Ex01:
Used a CNN model for prediction.
We saw that for numbers "01" the label was "0" and for "10" the label was "1" in validation set according to API requests.
It seems like labels are the first number from the left.
We pre-processed our data to keep only the left part of each picture, trained and predicted the labels on those partial images.
